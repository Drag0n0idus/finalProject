# Maturita Project - Achievement Social Platform
Three interconnected application systems for viewing achievements from Steam.

## Our Goal
A system in kind with sites like [Completionist.me](https://completionist.me/) or [Astats](https://astats.astats.nl/astats/), with one main difference - not only is there going to be a web interface (like on the sites mentioned), but also a desktop interface and a mobile application.

## Which languages and systems will we be using?
For the web interface, Nette. For the desktop and mobile applications, Java. For the database, PhpMyAdmin and MySQL.

I get it. Why use Nette, Java and/or MySQL, when there are so many better ways to do these things. But not only are we students with limited knowledge, we don't have resources to learn and work with different, often more complex languages.
